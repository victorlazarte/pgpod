         <title>How to Start Google</title>
         <description>March 2024
(This is a talk I gave to 14 and 15 year olds about what to do now
if they might want to start a startup later. Lots of schools think
they should tell students something about startups. This is what I
think they should tell them.)
Most of you probably think that when you're released into the
so-called real world you'll eventually have to get some kind of
job. That's not true, and today I'm going to talk about a trick you
can use to avoid ever having to get a jobs .

         <title>The Reddits</title>
         <description>March 2024
I met the Reddits before we even started Y Combinator. In fact they
were one of the reasons we started it.
YC grew out of a talk I gave to the Harvard Computer Society (the
undergrad computer club) about how to start a startup. Everyone
else in the audience was probably local, but Steve and Alexis came
up on the train from the University of Virginia, where they were
seniors. Since they'd come so far I agreed to meet them for coffee.

         <title>Is There Such a Thing as Good Taste?</title>
         <description>November 2021
(This essay is derived from a talk at the Cambridge Union.)
When I was a kid, I'd have said there wasn't. My father told me so.
Some people like some things, and other people like other things,
and who's to say who's right?
It seemed so obvious that there was no such thing as good taste
that it was only through indirect evidence that I realized my father
was wrong. And that's what I'm going to give you here: a proof by
reductio ad absurdum. If we start from the premise that there's...</description>

         <title>The Origins of Wokeness</title>
         <description>January 2025
The word &quot;prig&quot; isn't very common now, but if you look up
the definition, it will sound familiar. Google's isn't bad:


  A self-righteously moralistic person who behaves as if
  superior to others.


This sense of the word originated in the 18th century, and
its age is an important clue: it shows that although
wokeness is a comparatively recent phenomenon, it's an
instance of a much older one.
There's a certain kind of person who's attracted to a

in his life, forgot to take notes. I'm not going to try to reproduce

         <title>The Need to Read</title>
         <description>November 2022
In the science fiction books I read as a kid, reading had often
been replaced by some more efficient way of acquiring knowledge.
Mysterious &quot;tapes&quot; would load it into one's brain like a program
being loaded into a computer.
That sort of thing is unlikely to happen anytime soon. Not just
because it would be hard to build a replacement for reading, but
because even if one existed, it would be insufficient. Reading about
x doesn't just teach you about x; it also teaches you how to wri...</description>

         <title>Alien Truth</title>
         <description>October 2022
If there were intelligent beings elsewhere in the universe, they'd
share certain truths in common with us. The truths of mathematics
would be the same, because they're true by definition. Ditto for
the truths of physics; the mass of a carbon atom would be the same
on their planet. But I think we'd share other truths with aliens
besides the truths of math and physics, and that it would be
worthwhile to think about what these might be.
For example, I think we'd share the principle tha...</description>

         <description>November 2022
Since I was about 9 I've been puzzled by the apparent contradiction
between being made of matter that behaves in a predictable way, and
the feeling that I could choose to do whatever I wanted. At the
time I had a self-interested motive for exploring the question. At
that age (like most succeeding ages) I was always in trouble with
the authorities, and it seemed to me that there might possibly be
some way to get out of trouble by arguing that I wasn't responsible
for my actions. I g...</description>

         <title>Putting Ideas into Words</title>
         <description>February 2022
Writing about something, even something you know well, usually shows
you that you didn't know it as well as you thought. Putting ideas
into words is a severe test. The first words you choose are usually
wrong; you have to rewrite sentences over and over 
 to
get them exactly right. And your ideas won't just be imprecise, but
incomplete too. Half the ideas that end up in an essay will be ones
you thought of while you were writing it. Indeed, that's why I write
them.

There's some debate about whether it's a good idea to &quot;follow your
passion.&quot; In fact the question is impossible to answer with a simple
yes or no. Sometimes you should and sometimes you shouldn't, but
the border between should and shouldn't is very complicated. The
only way to give a general answer is to trace it.

That tests a lot of things: whether you're paying attention to
users, how well you understand them, and even how much they need
what you're making.
Afterward I asked myself the same question. What have I learned
from YC's users, the startups we've funded?

         <description>October 2023
One of the most important things I didn't understand about the world
when I was a child is the degree to which the returns for performance
are superlinear.
Teachers and coaches implicitly told us the returns were linear.
&quot;You get out,&quot; I heard a thousand times, &quot;what you put in.&quot; They
meant well, but this is rarely true. If your product is only half
as good as your competitor's, you don't get half as many customers.
You get no customers, and you go out of business.

         <description>July 2024
Successful people tend to be persistent. New ideas often don't work
at first, but they're not deterred. They keep trying and eventually
find something that does.
Mere obstinacy, on the other hand, is a recipe for failure. Obstinate
people are so annoying. They won't listen. They beat their heads
against a wall and get nowhere.
But is there any real difference between these two cases? Are
persistent and obstinate people actually behaving differently? Or
are they doing the same thing, an...</description>

If you collected lists of techniques for doing great work in a lot

Partly my goal was to create a guide that could be used by someone

         <title>Beyond Smart</title>
         <description>October 2021
If you asked people what was special about Einstein, most would say
that he was really smart. Even the ones who tried to give you a
more sophisticated-sounding answer would probably think this first.
Till a few years ago I would have given the same answer myself. But
that wasn't what was special about Einstein. What was special about
him was that he had important new ideas. Being very smart was a
necessary precondition for having those ideas, but the two are not
identical.

         <title>What to Do</title>
         <description>March 2025
What should one do? That may seem a strange question, but it's not
meaningless or unanswerable. It's the sort of question kids ask
before they learn not to ask big questions. I only came across it
myself in the process of investigating something else. But once I
did, I thought I should at least try to answer it.
So what 
should
 one do? One should help people, and take care of
the world. Those two are obvious. But is there anything else? When
I ask that, the answer that pops up is

         <title>A Project of One's Own</title>
         <description>June 2021
A few days ago, on the way home from school, my nine year old son
told me he couldn't wait to get home to write more of the story he
was working on. This made me as happy as anything I've heard him
say — not just because he was excited about his story, but because
he'd discovered this way of working. Working on a project of your
own is as different from ordinary work as skating is from walking.
It's more fun, but also much more productive.

         <title>How to Work Hard</title>
         <description>June 2021
It might not seem there's much to learn about how to work hard.
Anyone who's been to school knows what it entails, even if they
chose not to do it. There are 12 year olds who work amazingly hard. And
yet when I ask if I know more about working hard now than when I
was in school, the answer is definitely yes.
One thing I know is that if you want to do great things, you'll
have to work very hard. I wasn't sure of that as a kid. Schoolwork
varied in difficulty; one didn't always have to w...</description>

         <description>October 2024
I'm usually reluctant to make predictions about technology, but I
feel fairly confident about this one: in a couple decades there
won't be many people who can write.
One of the strangest things you learn if you're a writer is how
many people have trouble writing. Doctors know how many people have
a mole they're worried about; people who are good at setting up
computers know how many people aren't; writers know how many people
need help writing.
The reason so many people have trouble...</description>

         <title>Weird Languages</title>
         <description>August 2021
When people say that in their experience all programming languages
are basically equivalent, they're making a statement not about
languages but about the kind of programming they've done.
99.5% of programming consists of gluing together calls to library
functions. All popular languages are equally good at this. So one
can easily spend one's whole career operating in the intersection
of popular programming languages.
But the other .5% of programming is disproportionately interesting.

         <title>Heresy</title>
         <description>April 2022
One of the most surprising things I've witnessed in my lifetime is
the rebirth of the concept of heresy.
In his excellent biography of Newton, Richard Westfall writes about the
moment when he was elected a fellow of Trinity College:


  Supported comfortably, Newton was free to devote himself wholly
  to whatever he chose. To remain on, he had only to avoid the three
  unforgivable sins: crime, heresy, and marriage.

         <title>How to Get New Ideas</title>
         <description>January 2023
(
Someone
 fed my essays into GPT to make something that could answer
questions based on them, then asked it where good ideas come from.  The
answer was ok, but not what I would have said. This is what I would have said.)
The way to get new ideas is to notice anomalies: what seems strange,
or missing, or broken? You can see anomalies in everyday life (much
of standup comedy is based on this), but the best place to look for
them is at the frontiers of knowledge.
